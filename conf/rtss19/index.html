                Tutorial Abstract</b>:<br/>
            <ul>Conventional real-time embedded systems have over the past two decades vividly evolved into an open,
              interconnected form, now known as cyber-physical systems (CPS), that integrates capabilities of computing,
              communication and control, thereby triggering yet another round of global revolution of the information
              technology. The underlying safety-critical feature, however, impels the community to tackle the grand
              challenge concerning analysis, verification and design of reliable CPS. Hybrid systems that seamlessly
              integrate continuous dynamics with discrete behaviors have been extensively used as mathematical models
              for CPS, wherein prominent formal techniques, e.g., reachability-based model checking, deduction-based
              theorem proving and correct-by-construction synthesis, have been developed for ensuring correctness of
              hybrid systems. In this tutorial, we will start with a lightweight introduction to CPS and hybrid systems
              in a safety-critical context and then present our efforts over the recent years in testing, verification
              and design of CPS, particularly addressing inherent features thereof like large-scale, nondeterminism and
              delayed coupling.<br/><br/>The tutorial is scheduled in three sessions. The first session sketches an
              overview of formal verification of CPS and Hybrid Automata (HA) as the model for hybrid systems
              underneath, followed by path-oriented/enumeration techniques addressing bounded model checking of complex
              HA while tackling nondeterminism therein with an online modelling and verification framework. In the
              second session, we show how to use proper design patterns to simplify HA verification and contrarily how
              to exploit HA to assist testing of real-time CPS. We dedicate the third session to the verification and
              design of time-delayed systems ubiquitously existing in networked and distributed control. We present
              various approaches to the automatic verification and correct-by-construction design of dynamical systems
              subject to delayed information exchange, with applications in a typical set of time-delayed dynamics
              originated from realms of biology, control and transportation.</li>

            CPS, particularly those who are interested in testing, verification and synthesis.</a></li>
